# Exercise 5: More about variables and printing

my_name = "Vishal Bisht" # My name
my_age = 26 # Current age
my_hieght = 65 # In inches
my_weight = 85 # In Kgs
my_eyes = "Brown" # Eye color
my_teeth = "White" # Teeth color
my_hair = "Black" # Color of my hairs

print(f"Let's talk about {my_name}") # New way of printing the vaiable in print function
print(f"He's {my_hieght} inches tall") # Printing height
print(f"He's {my_weight} kgs heavy") # Printing weight
print("Actually that's too heavy. He is working on to reduce it ;)")
print(f"He's got {my_eyes} eyes and {my_hair} hair") # Printing about eyes and hair color
print(f"He's teeth are usually {my_teeth} depending upon the chai") # Talking about the teeth

#This line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = my_age + my_hieght + my_weight # adding age, height, weight
print(f"If I add {my_age}, {my_hieght}, {my_weight} I get {total}") # Printing the total
